    <p>This is Vesa Keskinen, owner of the Tuurin kyläkauppa. He is my role model. This is a picture of him after having plastic surgery to look even handsomer.</p>
    <p>He is a legendary finnish business entrepenaur and has branched out to many different areas of business.</p>
    <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Current owner of Keskisen Kyläkauppa Tuuri, his shopping center in Tuuri. One of the largest shops in europe.</li>
            <li>He also has started brining women from africa to finland as a sorts of mail-order-bride thing. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aQ9jDuvKKY">Here</a> is a document of this, made by a finnish independant investigator.</li>
            <li>He has also held multiple ice fishing competitions.</li>
        </ul>
